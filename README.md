# enhanced-shortcuts
Making some new shortcuts for chromium browsers that I feel would be nice to have
I'll add more as I get ideas

__Shortcut 1: Copy Current URL__
Copies the URL of the page that is currently focused by pressing Alt+C, or Control+C on Macs (not command)
Got the idea for this from arc which I used for a bit, so credits to the browser company for the idea
